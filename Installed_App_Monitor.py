    Monitors changes in installed applications and sends email notifications.

    This function runs in an infinite loop, periodically checking for changes
    in the list of installed applications. If changes are detected, it sends
    an email report and updates the log files.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Extracts the current list of installed applications.
    2. Writes this list to a temporary file.
    3. Compares the temporary file with the existing log file.
    4. If changes are detected:
       - Reads the content of the temporary file.
       - Sends an email with the updated list of applications.
       - Updates the main log file.
       - Clears the temporary file.
    5. Waits for 3 minutes before the next check.

    Note:
    - This function does not take any parameters.
    - It does not return any value as it runs indefinitely.
    - The function relies on several helper functions: Extract_installed_apps(),
      Write_file(), Compare_content(), send_email(), and Clear_file().
    - The email recipient is hardcoded as "Jitin.k.sengar@gmail.com".
